to make a weather-clock, you will need:
some boards like arduino / esp8266 / raspberry pi
temperature sensor, i use DHT22
a monitor to display the data, i use a tiny monitor with HDMI input
some other API services for more information to be displayed

remember to have http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json for additional boards manager if you use esp8266 board
